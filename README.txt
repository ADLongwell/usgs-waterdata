The usgs-waterdata library is a tool for obtaining real-time and statistical river flow data from the United States Geological Survey's National Water Information System. It will fetch a list of all rivers for which gauge data exists along with the gauges on that river. For a particular gauge, the library will obtain the latest flow, the mean flow on all days for which data exists, and long-term statistical flow data.
